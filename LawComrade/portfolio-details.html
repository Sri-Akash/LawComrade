              <h2>Facts of the Case</h2>
              <p>
                In this case, the petitioner, along with five others, was engaged in the business of preparing,
                printing, and publications of textbooks for various school level classes, especially the primary and
                secondary level books in the State of Punjab under the name of “Uttar Chand Kapur and Sons”. It is done
                as per their right to carry out their own business and trade and is legally valid. It was reported that
                the Education Department under the State government of Punjab had come up with a policy on nationalizing
                this business of trading, publishing and printing the textbooks, and the same was notified through
                different notifications for this purpose to businessmen. Knowing this, the petitioners have filed a
                petition under Article 32 of the Indian Constitution alleging that the act of nationalizing the
                publications and printings of books would interfere with their right to freedom of trade and business
                under Article 19(1) (g) of the constitution and had practically driven out them from this business. It
                was urged that such a restriction has been laid on them without any proper legislative backings for such
                a policy, and mere notifications not conforming to the requirements under Article 19(6) shall make the
                policy invalid and unconstitutional. Thus, they sought the court to issue the writ of mandamus, which
                would enable the state government to disable the said notifications.

                <br><br>
                <strong>Issues:</strong>

                Whether the said notifications violate the fundamental rights of the petitioners under Article 19 (1)
                (g) of the Indian Constitution or not?
                Whether legislative backings are required for the purpose and do that needs to be complied with as per
                article 19(6) or not?

                <br><br>
                <strong>Laws involved:</strong>

                Article 19(1) (g) – Right to practice any profession or to carry out any occupation, trade, or business
                by the citizens.
                Article 19(6) – Nothing in sub-clause (g) of the article 19 (1) shall affect the operation of any
                existing law in so far as it imposes, or prevent the State from making any law imposing, in the
                interests of the general public, reasonable restrictions on the exercise of the right conferred by the
                said sub-clause (g), or prevent the State from making any law relating to,
                (ii) the carrying on by the State, or by a corporation owned or controlled by the State, of any trade,
                business, industry or service, whether to the exclusion, complete or partial, of citizens

                <br><br>
                <strong>Contentions of the parties:</strong>


                Petitioners in this case put forth their three main contentions as follows:

                Firstly, it was argued that the state government of Punjab had no legal background through legislation
                in order to carry on with any trade or business activity. They also pointed out that their policy to
                establish a monopoly in the trade and business of publication of books and printings activity is illegal
                in nature and has no jurisdiction to do so.
                Secondly, it was also contended by the petitioners that if the government want to establish a monopoly,
                then such a policy should be considered only after enacting a legislature to give effect to the same,
                and that should also comply with the essentials provided under article 19(6) of the Indian Constitution.
                They argued that the state government should not be in the position to deprive the interests and rights
                of the petitioners unless the government has enacted the law for the purpose and the obligation to pay
                the compensation has also been fulfilled as has been required under article 31 of the Indian
                Constitution.

                <br><br>
                <strong>Decision:</strong>


                The court observed and held as follows.

                With respect to the first question on whether there was a violation of fundamental rights of the
                petitioners through the act by the state government, the court refused to accept the petitioners argued
                that there was a violation of fundamental rights under article 19(1) (g). It observed that, when it
                comes to school books, it is the school who should suggest the kind of books, and it is not the right of
                publishers to insist the students or school for acceptance of their books as textbooks. It noted that
                when a trader is lucky enough in the market, his goods would be secured, but if he loses any such trade,
                then he or she shall not state that his or her fundamental right to have the customers has been
                violated. Thus, it stated and held that the scopes of such chances are incidental to each business, and
                there is no fundamental right in the present case.
                Lastly, With respect to the second issue, the court firstly the importance of articles 73 and 162 of the
                Indian Constitution as it deals with executive powers and the extent to which parliament and state
                powers are executed. In that way, it was observed by the court that a modern state should be expected to
                engage in all the activities that are required for the welfare of the people of the country. It also
                observed that in order to carry on particular trade or business, it is indeed required that special
                legislation is enacted for additional requirement of powers other than what has been provided to an
                executive as per law. In that situation, special legislation would be required to encroach upon the
                privacy rights, for that matter. As the question of whether there was a violation of the fundamental
                rights of petitioners was dismissed, it is also immaterial to state whether the government could, in a
                way, have powers to establish a monopoly without law under article 19(6) of the constitution shall
                remain immaterial as well.
                Thus the petition was dismissed by the Supreme Court of India.
